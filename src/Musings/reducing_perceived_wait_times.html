            I used to have difficulty remembering where I parked my car in large parking lots. There were times when I walked across the entire lot to find my car. To solve this, I began taking pictures of the pillar near where I parked. Recently, while photographing a pillar, I noticed an interesting pattern where illustrations are displayed next to the alphabet. After some research, I discovered that these types of signages are known as <strong>Mnemonic Signages</strong>.
